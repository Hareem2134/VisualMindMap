You are an expert front-end web developer and UI/UX designer with a specialization in creating visually stunning, modern, and highly professional websites for international businesses and premium e-commerce brands.
Your Task:
Design and generate the complete HTML, CSS (and minimal JavaScript if necessary for animations) for a single-page (or key landing page) website. The website should embody the essence of a prestigious international brand. It needs to be attractive, trustworthy, and exude quality.
Theme & Purpose:
The website is for a high-end, [User to specify type of business/e-commerce here, e.g., "luxury sustainable fashion brand," "global innovative technology solutions provider," "bespoke travel consultancy," "premium artisanal coffee e-commerce store"]. The goal is to impress potential clients/customers, showcase brand values, and encourage engagement (e.g., inquiries, newsletter sign-ups, or product exploration).
Part 1: Color Palette Suggestions (Crucial First Step)
Before generating any code, please suggest THREE distinct color palette options suitable for this high-end, international brand theme. For each palette, provide:
Palette Name/Concept: (e.g., "Monochromatic Elegance," "Tech Forward," "Organic Luxury")
Primary Color: (HEX code and name, e.g., #0A2342 - Deep Sapphire Blue)
Secondary Color(s): (HEX code(s) and name(s), for accents, CTAs, or secondary elements)
Accent Color: (HEX code and name, to be used sparingly for highlights and calls-to-action)
Neutral Colors: (HEX codes and names, for text, backgrounds, borders â€“ include light and dark options, e.g., off-whites, light grays, dark grays, near-blacks)
Rationale: A brief explanation of why this palette is suitable for the brand type, the mood it evokes (e.g., "trustworthy and innovative," "luxurious and sophisticated," "calm and reliable"), and how it ensures excellent color contrast for readability (WCAG AA compliance as a minimum).
I will review your palette suggestions and choose ONE. Only after I've made my selection should you proceed to Part 2.

Part 2: Website Generation (Using the Chosen Palette)
Once I've selected a color palette, proceed to generate the website with the following specifications:
Key Design Principles:
Stunning & Modern UI: Clean, uncluttered, intuitive, and visually engaging. Think Apple, Stripe, or high-end fashion/luxury brand websites.
Impactful Animations & Transitions:
Subtle page load animations (e.g., fade-ins, slide-ins for elements).
Smooth hover effects on interactive elements (buttons, links, cards).
Parallax scrolling effects (optional, if it enhances the design without being distracting).
Transitions between sections if it's a single-page scrolling design.
Animations should be smooth, purposeful, and not overwhelming. CSS animations/transitions preferred; use JavaScript only if absolutely necessary for complexity.
Strong Visual Hierarchy: Guide the user's eye effectively.
Premium Typography: Use elegant, readable web-safe fonts or suggest Google Fonts pairings that fit the brand. Ensure excellent legibility and hierarchy in text.
High-Quality Imagery (Placeholders): Use placeholder images (e.g., from Unsplash, Pexels, or via https://placehold.co/) that evoke the brand's premium nature. Specify appropriate aspect ratios.
Responsive Design: The website must be fully responsive and look flawless on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Use a mobile-first approach if appropriate.
Accessibility: Adhere to WCAG AA guidelines where possible, especially for color contrast (using the chosen palette), keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.
Website Sections (for a typical landing page):
Navigation Bar:
Logo placeholder on the left.
Navigation links (e.g., Home, About Us, Services/Products, Blog, Contact).
A clear Call-to-Action (CTA) button (e.g., "Get a Quote," "Shop Now").
Should be sticky or appear on scroll if appropriate for UX.
Hero Section:
Compelling headline and sub-headline.
High-impact background (image, subtle video loop placeholder, or gradient).
Primary CTA button.
Minimalist, elegant design.
About Us/Brand Story Snippet:
Brief introduction to the company's mission, values, or unique selling proposition.
May include a professional image or abstract graphic.
Services/Product Showcase (Key Offerings):
Visually appealing cards or sections highlighting 2-4 key services or product categories.
Use icons (SVG placeholders or descriptions) and brief descriptions.
Subtle hover animations on cards.
Testimonials/Social Proof (Optional but Recommended):
A section to display client testimonials or partner logos.
Clean slider or static quotes.
Call to Action (Secondary):
Another prominent CTA, perhaps for a newsletter signup or a more detailed inquiry.
Footer:
Copyright information.
Social media icons (SVG placeholders).
Important links (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service placeholders).
Contact details (address, phone, email placeholders).
Technical Requirements:
HTML5: Semantic and well-structured.
CSS3: Modern CSS, using Flexbox and/or Grid for layout. Use CSS custom properties (variables) for the chosen color palette, fonts, and common spacing to make future adjustments easier.
JavaScript: Keep it minimal. If used, ensure it's clean, well-commented, and unobtrusive.
No External CSS Frameworks: (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) unless you feel it's absolutely necessary and explicitly state why. The goal is a custom, bespoke look.
Code Comments: Comment key sections of HTML and CSS for clarity.
Image Placeholders: Use services like https://placehold.co/ or https://picsum.photos/ for images, clearly indicating dimensions (e.g., https://placehold.co/1200x800).
